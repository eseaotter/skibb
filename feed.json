Irish Pubs have been enduring symbols of community, enjoyment, and family in the small nation of Ireland. However, with shifts in alcohol consumption habits, the impact of COVID-19, the migration of Irish youth, and the trials faced by family businesses, the traditional Irish Pub is facing a complex evolution in Ireland and around the world. I hope to combine unique pub stories with current events to exemplify all angles of this change.<br>\n  </p>",
